    <h1>Breast Cancer</h1>
    <p>Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, predominantly affecting women but also occurring in men. It arises when cells in the breast grow uncontrollably, forming tumors that can invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Risk factors include genetics, age, lifestyle, and hormonal influences. Early diagnosis is crucial as it significantly improves survival rates and treatment outcomes. Techniques such as mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, along with advancements in deep learning for image analysis, have enhanced the ability to detect breast cancer in its early stages, often before symptoms arise. Early detection allows for less aggressive treatments and a better prognosis, underscoring the importance of regular screenings and public awareness.</p>
